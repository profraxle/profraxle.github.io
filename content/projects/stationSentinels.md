A top down shooter with procedural levels

Created for the Game Programming and System Architectures Module at Abertay University, this project was a collaboration with another student where we made a top down shooter using Abertay's Games Education Framework.

I mainly worked on:

    Tile Based Level Generation
    Enemy AI and A Star Pathfinding
    3D Modelling
