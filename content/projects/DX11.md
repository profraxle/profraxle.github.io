An island scene created in DirectX 11

Created for the Graphics Programming with Shaders Module at Abertay University, this project was used to explore DX11's graphics pipeline and get used to working with:

  -  Vertex Shaders
  -  Pixel Shaders
  -  Hull Shaders
  -  Tesselation
  -  Post Processing

I got an A+ grade for implementing these features and in the year after this project, I worked as a lab assistant on the same module, offering guidance to students undertaking the same coursework.
