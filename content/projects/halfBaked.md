A wacky VR puzzle game where the player has no legs and must use their floppy half-baked arms to drag themselves and climb through the environment.

Made for the Professional Project Module at Abertay University, production took place from January to May 2024 in my third year of study.

I was mainly the VR mechanics programmer, and focused on implementing the core player controller throughout development.
